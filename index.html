       After your system is restored and working, please contact Support@Software.com. We will evaluate your problem and then assist you with the 3.0 upgrade.

<em><strong>1.9.3, 2.0, 3.0 Only - NT Only - What should I do if I was unable to upgrade </strong><strong>successfully to version 3.0 and I don’t have a standard, full system backup, just the </strong><strong>registry backup made during the upgrade with Setup.exe?</strong></em>

You should have made a complete backup of your Post.Office system before upgrading (as instructed in the README.TXT and RELNOTES.TXT files). If you did not make a standard, full system backup as instructed, you will need to rely on the partial backup which was made during the upgrade.

Note: The registry backup made during the upgrade copies registry information only. Your mailbox directories and the executable directory were <em>not</em> backed up, and some 2.0 conversion tasks may have been performed on them. The converted executable directory cannot be used; it should be moved and replaced with the prior version of the executables which can be downloaded directly from our ftp site. We are also performing mailbox conversions during this upgrade and the half-converted directory can not be used. Part of these instructions will be to run a utility that will take your converted mailbox directories and files and restore them to the prior versions structure.

The instructions that follow will guide you through the restoration process. They assume that you are using the registry backup files created during the upgrade.
<ol>
 	<li>Make sure that you are logged in as the Local Administrator of your host. Logging in as the Domain Administrator is not sufficient unless the machine you are using is a Primary Domain Controller.</li>
 	<li>Shutdown the Post.Office Service:
Panel -&gt; Services -&gt; Post.Office MTA -&gt; Stop</li>
 	<li>Set permissions to the default permissions for your Post.Office-User using the poperms utility delivered with Post.Office version 3.0. Return to the DOS command line (within the Program directory\others) and type:
poperms -a -u</li>
 	<li>Back up the half converted 3.0 version of the Post.Office Registry key:
<ul>
 	<li>Launch REGEDT32.exe.</li>
 	<li>Follow the path HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/software.com
to locate the Post.Office key.</li>
 	<li>Select the Post.Office key.</li>
 	<li>Pull down the Registry menu and choose the Save Key command.
(suggested name to save under: Post.OfficeRegKey3.0)</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Restore the prior version of the Post.Office Registry key that was saved during the upgrade:
<ul>
 	<li>Make sure that the Post.Office key remains selected (highlighted).</li>
 	<li>Pull down the Registry menu and choose the Restore command.</li>
 	<li>Locate and select your automatic backup copy of the prior Post.Office Registry key (post-office-Reg) then click on the Opeb button.
(It’s located by default in \winnt35\system32\spool\PostOfficeBackup.)</li>
 	<li>Confirm your desire to overwrite the current key by clicking on the YES button of the alert box that appears.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Download the executable archive file or your prior version of Post.Office by following the ftp instructions below:
<ul>
 	<li>From the DOS prompt, change to the directory immediately above the Post.Office executables directory. For example, if your Post.Office executables directory is \win32app\post.office, please cd to \win32app.</li>
 	<li>Type: ftp ftp.software.com</li>
 	<li>Log in as anonymous.</li>
 	<li>Use your e-mail address as the password.</li>
 	<li>Change directory to the location of the appropriate package by typing
cd ftp\post.office\&lt;archive\&lt;version no.&gt;\nt\&lt;yourplatform&gt;\utilities\</li>
 	<li>Download the executables in binary mode by typing:
bin
get poexec-&lt;platform&gt;-&lt;version#&gt;.zip</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Back up the Post.Office 3.0 executables you have now.
<ul>
 	<li>Launch the File Manager.</li>
 	<li>Locate and select the Post.Office directory.
(the default location is \win32app\Post.Office)</li>
 	<li>From the File menu choose the Move command.</li>
 	<li>Type the new name and location in the To: field provided, then click on the OK button.(suggested name and location is <em>anotherhost</em>\temp\Post.Office3.0exec)</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Move the Post.Office.dll out of the system directory (WINNT/system32) and rename it (suggested name: 30postoffice.save).</li>
 	<li>Restore your prior version Post.Office executables (the ones you just downloaded).
<ul>
 	<li>From the File Manger, locate the Post.Office executables archive file and unzip it.</li>
 	<li>This will create a new Post.Office directory containing your prior versions executables. (If you are restoring to Post.Office version 2.0, you will need to create this Post.Office directory by hand.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Back up the current Post.Office 3.0 configuration information.
<ul>
 	<li>Locate and select the Post.Office directory.
(the default location is \winnt35\system32\spool\Post.Office)</li>
 	<li>From the File menu choose the Copy command.</li>
 	<li>Type the new name and location in the To: field provided, then click on the OK button. (suggested name and location is <em>anotherhost</em>\temp\Post.Office3.0config)</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Back up the Post.Office 3.0 mailboxes you have now.
<ul>
 	<li>Locate and select the Post.Office mailbox directory.
(the default location is \winnt35\system32\spool\Post.Office\mailbox)</li>
 	<li>From the File menu choose the Copy command.</li>
 	<li>Type the new name and location in the To: field provided, then click on the OK button. (suggested name and location is anotherhost\temp\Post.Office3.0mailbox)</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>We have written a perl script to help convert your mailbox directories from the new 3.0 structure to the old structure. Assuming that the upgrade got this far and has bucketed your mailboxes. If this step was not completed, you may not need to perform this step.
Note: You can download perl from the ftp site ntperl.hip.com. Download from our ftp site a utility called unbucket.pl and run it using the following instructions:
<ul>
 	<li>Type: ftp ftp.software.com</li>
 	<li>Log in as anonymous.</li>
 	<li>Use your e-mail address as the password.</li>
 	<li>Change directory to the location of the utility by typing
cd ftp\postoffice\archive\&lt;version no.&gt;\nt\&lt;yourplatform&gt;\utilities\</li>
 	<li>Download the executables in binary mode by typing:
bin
get unbucket.pl
quit</li>
 	<li>Move the unbucket.pl utility to your mailbox directory.</li>
 	<li>Run the command by typing the following:
cd winnt\system32\spool\post.office\mailbox
perl unbucket.pl</li>
 	<li>The bucketed mailboxes will be copied back up to the unbucketed structure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>If you are restoring to Post.Office version 2.0, you will need to locate the 2.0 version of our poperms utility on our ftp site (ftp ftp.software.com). It can be found by following the path through the 2.0 version/operating system/platform/utilities directories. Run the poperms tool to set permissions back to the default settings. Return to the DOS command line (within the Post.Office executables directory) and type:
poperms -a -u</li>
 	<li>If you are restoring to Post.Office version 1.9.3, you will need to manually verify that your Registry and file system permissions are correct. Please refer to the section of this FAQ titled <em>Permissions and Directory Locations</em> which identifies the proper permission settings for Post.Office v1.9.3.</li>
 	<li>Startup the Post.Office Service:
Panel -&gt; Services -&gt; Post.Office MTA -&gt; Start

<em>This procedure does not alter the Post.Office applet icon. You’ll see the new 3.0 icon, </em><em>but all other indications will correctly reflect the fact that you are running your prior version </em><em>of Post.Office.</em></li>
</ol>
After your system is restored and working, please contact Support@Software.com. We will evaluate your problem and then assist you with the 3.0 upgrade. </section>
